# pandoc-arm64

PKGBUILD files to re-package arm64 (from Debian) builds of pandoc and pandoc-citeproc and required dependencies for Arch Linux. 

Tested and working on Manjaro Linux running on both Pinebook Pro and PinePhone hardware.

## Additional Notes

This is an effort to make Pandoc compatible with [Danct12's](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded) [Pine64-Arch kernel](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Pine64-Arch). Please refer to [cbrown1's](https://github.com/cbrown1) original [pandoc-arm64](https://github.com/cbrown1/pandoc-arm64) repository for other device/kernel combinations.
